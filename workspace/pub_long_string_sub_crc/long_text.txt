"mROS 2 (formally `mros2`) realizes a agent-less and lightweight runtime environment compatible with ROS 2 for embedded devices.\n"
"mROS 2 mainly offers pub/sub APIs compatible with [rclcpp](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/p/rclcpp/index.html) for embedded devices.\n"
"\n"
"mROS 2 consists of communication library for pub/sub APIs, RTPS protocol, UDP/IP stack, and real-time kernel.\n"
"This repository provides the reference implementation of mROS 2 that can be operated on the Mbed enabled board.\n"
"Please also check [mros2 repository](https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2) for more details and another implementations.\n"
"\n"
"## Supported environment\n"
"\n"
"- Mbed device\n"
"  - Board: Mbed enabled boards having an Ethernet port  \n"
"    - For now, these boards below are confirmed to run the example on them.\n"
"      - [STM32 NUCLEO-F767ZI](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f767zi.html)\n"
"      - [STM32 NUCLEO-H743ZI2](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-h743zi.html)\n"
"    - These boards below are also confirmed but not always supported in the latest version (due to our development resources,,,).\n"
"      - [STM32 NUCLEO-F429ZI](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f429zi.html)\n"
"      - [STM32 F746NG-Discovery](https://www.st.com/ja/evaluation-tools/32f746gdiscovery.html)\n"
"      - [STM32 F769NI-Discovery](https://www.st.com/ja/evaluation-tools/32f769idiscovery.html)\n"
"      - [Seeed Arch Max V1.1](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Arch_Max_v1.1/)\n"
"      - [RENESAS GR-MANGO](https://www.renesas.com/products/gadget-renesas/boards/gr-mango)\n"
"  - Kernel: [Mbed OS 6](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os)\n"
"  - check the Mbed website for [the boards list](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/?q=&Mbed+OS+6=Bare+metal&Mbed+OS+6=RTOS&Communication=Ethernet) where mros2 may work. Please let us know if you find a new board that can work as mros2 enabled device.\n"
"- Host environment\n"
"  - [ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\n"
"  - [ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html) on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\n"
"- Network setting\n"
"  - Make sure both the device and the host are connected to the wired network with the following setting, since they are statically configured to the board (if you want to change them, please edit both `app.cpp` and `include/rtps/config.h`).\n"
"    - IP address: 192.168.11.x\n"
"      - .2 will be assigned to the board\n"
"    - Netmask: 255.255.255.0\n"
"    - Gateway: 192.168.11.1\n"
"  - The firewall on the host (Ubuntu) needs to be disabled for ROS 2 (DDS) communication (e.g. `$ sudo ufw disable`).\n"
"  - If the host is connected to the Internet other than wired network (e.g., Wi-Fi), communication with mros2 may not work properly. In that case, please turn off them.\n"
"\n"
"## Getting Started\n"
"\n"
"1. Prepare these items below.\n"
"- Host PC having an Ethernet port whose network is set to the above and a docker environment.\n"
"- Mbed board having an Ethernet port (listed above).\n"
"2. Build Mbed executable binary using [the Docker environment for Mbed CLI2](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/pkgs/container/mbed-os-env).  \n"
"(You can also use the native environment where MBed CLI2 could work well. Please add `native` to 4th arg. (see [the example instruction to prepare native env](https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2-mbed/commit/90225c77e07e5cedc8473285b457827cb047e481)))\n"

"## Files for the application\n"
"\n"
"On this platform, the mros2 application consists of the following files:\n"
"\n"
"- app.cpp: \n"
"  - main source of the application\n"
"  - note that the file name must be this in order to generate the templates of pub/sub functions in the build step.\n"
"- templates.hpp:\n"
"  - the templates of pub/sub functions\n"
"  - this file will be automatically generated/modified during the build step, so you do not have to care about this file.\n"
"\n"
"## Generating header files for custom MsgTypes\n"
"\n"
"You can use almost any [built-in-types in ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/About-ROS-Interfaces.html#field-types) on the embedded device.\n"
"\n"
"In additon, you can define a customized message type (e.g., `Twist.msg`) in the same way as in ROS 2, and use its header file for your application. This section describes how to generate header files for your own MsgTypes (`geometry_msgs::msg::Twist` as an example).\n"
"\n"
"### Prepare .msg files\n"
"\n"
"`.msg` files are simple text files that describe the fields of a ROS message (see [About ROS 2 interface](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/About-ROS-Interfaces.html)). In mros2, they are used to generate header files for messages in embedded applications.\n"
"\n"
"Prepare `Twist.msg` file and make sure it is in `workspace/custom_msgs/geometry_msgs/msg/`.\n"
"\n"
"```\n"
"$ cat workspace/custom_msgs/geometry_msgs/msg/Twist.msg\n"
"geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3 linear\n"
"geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3 angular\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"In this example, `Twist` has a nested structure with `Vector3` as a child element. So you also need to prepare its file.\n"
"\n"
"```\n"
"$ cat workspace/custom_msgs/geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3.msg\n"
"float64 x\n"
"float64 y\n"
"float64 z\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"### Generate header files\n"
"\n"
"To generate header files for `Twist` and `Vector3`, run the following command in `workspace/`.\n"
"\n"
"```\n"
"$ cd workspace\n"
"$ python3 ../mros2/mros2_header_generator/header_generator.py geometry_msgs/msg/Twist.msg\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"Make sure header files for custom MsgType are generated in `custom_msgs/`.\n"
"\n"
"```\n"
"$ ls -R custom_msgs/\n"
"custom_msgs/:\n"
"geometry_msgs\n"
"\n"
"custom_msgs/geometry_msgs:\n"
"msg\n"
"\n"
"custom_msgs/geometry_msgs/msg:\n"
"twist.hpp  vector3.hpp  Twist.msg  Vector3.msg\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"You can now use them in your applicaton like this.\n"
"\n"
"```\n"
"#include \"mros2.hpp\"\n"
"#include \"geometry_msgs/msg/vector3.hpp\"\n"
"#include \"geometry_msgs/msg/twist.hpp\"\n"

"## Tips 1: Configure the network\n"
"\n"
"`include/rtps/config.h` is the configuration file for embeddedRTPS.\n"
"We may be able to realize the RTPS communication to the appropriate configuration by editting this file.\n"
"\n"
"And also, you can configure for lwIP (UDP/IP) by `mbed_app.json`. \n"
"Currently, we are unable to communicate large size of messages probably due to these configurations. \n"
"\n"
"We should seek the appropreate configurations or how to fit them to the demand of applications.\n"
"Please let us know about them if you have any opinions or awesome knowledges! \n"

"## Tips 2: Getting started in 5 minutes with the online compiler\n"
"\n"
"We also provide an online development environment for mros2-mbed. \n"
