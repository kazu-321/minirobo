# mturtle_teleop

This is a sample application along with [mturtlesim](https://github.com/mROS-base/ros_tutorials/tree/mros2/foxy-devel/turtlesim) (mros2 dedicated version of turtlesim).

The mROS 2 node on the embedded board publishes `Twist` (`geometry_msgs::msg::Twist`) message to `/turtle1/cmd_vel` topic, according to the input from keyboard via serial console.
The feature is almost the same as [ros2/teleop_twist_keyboard](https://github.com/ros2/teleop_twist_keyboard).

## Generate header files for Twist

See detail in [<repo_root>/README.md#generating-header-files-for-custom-msgtypes](../README.md#generating-header-files-for-custom-msgtypes).

## Build and Run for embedded devices

Make sure to set `app=mturtle_teleop` as `make` option.

```
### build the application
$ pwd
<snip.>/mros2-mbed
$ ./build.bash all NUCLEO_F767ZI mturtle_teleop
<snip.>
Total Static RAM memory (data + bss): 73880(+73880) bytes
Total Flash memory (text + data): 355652(+355652) bytes

### connect the board and then copy the binary manually.
$ cp cmake_build/NUCLEO_F767ZI/develop/GCC_ARM/mros2-mbed.bin /media/${USER}/NODE_F767ZI/
```

## Host operation for native ROS 2

Since the current version of does not support the QoS control, the original version of `turtlesim` could not work well with this application. So please use the following repository (that is customized for mros2) to clone repository and build package.

```
$ cd <your_ros2_ws>/src
$ git clone -b mros2/foxy-devel https://github.com/mROS-base/ros_tutorials
$ cd ..
$ colcon build --packages-select mturtlesim
$ source install/local_setup.bash
```

## Expected output

### serial console for the baord with mros2

```
$ picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyACM0
