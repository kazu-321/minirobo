# mros2-mbed

mROS 2 (formally `mros2`) realizes a agent-less and lightweight runtime environment compatible with ROS 2 for embedded devices.
mROS 2 mainly offers pub/sub APIs compatible with [rclcpp](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/p/rclcpp/index.html) for embedded devices.

mROS 2 consists of communication library for pub/sub APIs, RTPS protocol, UDP/IP stack, and real-time kernel.
This repository provides the reference implementation of mROS 2 that can be operated on the Mbed enabled board.
Please also check [mros2 repository](https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2) for more details and another implementations.

## Supported environment

- Mbed device
  - Board: Mbed enabled boards having an Ethernet port  
    - For now, these boards below are confirmed to run the example on them.
      - [STM32 NUCLEO-F767ZI](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f767zi.html)
      - [STM32 NUCLEO-H743ZI2](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-h743zi.html)
    - These boards below are also confirmed but not always supported in the latest version (due to our development resources,,,).
      - [STM32 NUCLEO-F429ZI](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f429zi.html)
      - [STM32 F746NG-Discovery](https://www.st.com/ja/evaluation-tools/32f746gdiscovery.html)
      - [STM32 F769NI-Discovery](https://www.st.com/ja/evaluation-tools/32f769idiscovery.html)
      - [Seeed Arch Max V1.1](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Arch_Max_v1.1/)
      - [RENESAS GR-MANGO](https://www.renesas.com/products/gadget-renesas/boards/gr-mango)
  - Kernel: [Mbed OS 6](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os)
  - check the Mbed website for [the boards list](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/?q=&Mbed+OS+6=Bare+metal&Mbed+OS+6=RTOS&Communication=Ethernet) where mros2 may work. Please let us know if you find a new board that can work as mros2 enabled device.
- Host environment
  - [ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
  - [ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html) on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Network setting
  - Make sure both the device and the host are connected to the wired network with the following setting, since they are statically configured to the board.
    - IP address: 192.168.11.2 (that will be assigned to the board)
    - Netmask: 255.255.255.0
    - Gateway: 192.168.11.1
      - You can configure them by editing `platform/mros2-platform.h`.
      - Note that we have not confirmed the operation using DHCP setting yet. So you cannot comment out the `#define MROS2_IP_ADDRESS_STATIC` line to assign static IP address.
  - The firewall on the host (Ubuntu) needs to be disabled for ROS 2 (DDS) communication (e.g. `$ sudo ufw disable`).
  - If the host is connected to the Internet other than wired network (e.g., Wi-Fi), communication with mros2 may not work properly. In that case, please turn off them.

## Getting Started

1. Prepare these items below.
- Host PC having an Ethernet port whose network is set to the above and a docker environment.
- Mbed board having an Ethernet port (listed above).
2. Build Mbed executable binary using [the Docker environment for Mbed CLI2](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/pkgs/container/mbed-os-env).  
(You can also use the native environment where MBed CLI2 could work well. Please add `native` to 4th arg. (see [the example instruction to prepare native env](https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2-mbed/commit/90225c77e07e5cedc8473285b457827cb047e481)))
```
git clone https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2-mbed
cd mros2-mbed
#(Please replace the [TARGET] with the ones as below.)
# +-------------------+----------------+
# | Your target board | [TARGET]       |
# +-------------------+----------------+
# | NUCLEO-F767ZI     | NUCLEO_F767ZI  |
# | NUCLEO-H743ZI2    | NUCLEO_H743ZI2 |
# | NUCLEO-F429ZI     | NUCLEO_F429ZI  |
# | F746NG-Discovery  | DISCO_F746NG   |
# | F769NI-Discovery  | DISCO_F769NI   |
# | Arch Max v1.1     | ARCH_MAX       |
# | GR-MANGO          | GR_MANGO       |
# +-------------------+----------------+
./build.bash all [TARGET] echoback_string
```
After that, you will find an executable binary is created in the path below.
```
cmake_build/[TARGET]/develop/GCC_ARM/mros2-mbed.bin
```
3. Connect the PC and Mbed Board with USB and LAN cables.
4. Open Serial Console of the Mbed board. (115200bps)
5. Copy the executable binary above to the Mbed Board.
   (you may find it in the Nautilus file manager as NODE_F429ZI, F767ZI or DAPLINK.)
```

...(SNIPPED)...
```
6. One of the easiest way to operate the host is using Docker. On the host terminal, type the command below.
```
docker run --rm -it --net=host ros:humble /bin/bash \
  -c "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash &&
  cd &&
  git clone https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2-host-examples &&
  cd mros2-host-examples &&
  colcon build --packages-select mros2_echoreply_string &&
  source install/setup.bash &&
  ros2 run mros2_echoreply_string echoreply_node"
```
Then, we can confirm the communication between the host and Mbed board via ROS 2 topic.

## Examples

This repository contains some example applications in [workspace/](workspace/) to communicate with ROS 2 nodes on the host.
You can switch the example by specifying the third argument of `build.bash`.
Of course you can also create a new program file and specify it as your own application.

Please also check [mROS-base/mros2-host-examples](https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2-host-examples) repository for more detail about the host examples.

### echoback_string (default)

  - The mROS 2 node on the embedded board publishes `string` (`std_msgs::msg::String`) message to `/to_linux` topic.
  - (The node on the host will echoreply this message as it is.)
  - The mROS 2 node subscribes the replied message from `/to_stm` topic.
- Host operation:
  - `$ ros2 run mros2_echoreply_string echoreply_node`

### echoreply_string

- Description:
  - The mROS 2 node on the embedded board subscribes `string` (`std_msgs::msg::String`) message from `/to_stm` topic.

### pub_long_string_sub_crc

- Description:
  - This sample application is an example to demonstrate the fragmented message feature added by the Pull-Request below.
    https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2-mbed/issues/32
  - The mROS 2 node on the embedded board publishes too long `string` (`std_msgs::msg::String`) message prepared in `long_text.txt` to the `/to_linux` topic.
  - (The node on the host will calculate the CRC value of subscribed long string, and publish the value as the reply.)
  - The mROS 2 node subscribes `uint32` (`std_msgs::msg::UInt32`) message as the calculated CRC value from `/to_stm` topic.

### pub_camera_image

- Description:
  - This sample application is an example to demonstrate the fragmented message feature added by the Pull-Request below.
    https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2-mbed/issues/32
  - The mROS 2 node on the embedded board publishes an `Image` (`sensor_msgs::msg::Image`) message to the `/to_linux` topic.
  - This sample uses the DCMI I/F of STM32 MCU as a camera I/F. The camera module to be used is the prevalence one like below.
    https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4166233
    - If you don't have the camera module but want to try publishing image, you can use `pub_image` sample instead (that publises a dummy image defined in `mros_image.h`).
  - For some NUCLEO boards (e.g., NUCELO-F429ZI), you might have to solder two pin headers on both PA8 and PB7 to connect them to XCLK and VSYNC respectively. The whole of the pin connections between the MCU and the camera module should be below.
    ```
    MCU         Camera module
    3.3V    ---      3V3
    GND     ---      GND
    PB9     ---      SDA
    PB8     ---      SCL
    PB7     ---      VSYNC
    PA4     ---      HSYNC(or HREF)
    PA6     ---      PIXCLK(or PCLK)
    PA8     ---      XCLK
    PE6     ---      D7
    PE5     ---      D6
    PB6     ---      D5
    PE4     ---      D4
    PC9     ---      D3
    PC8     ---      D2
    PC7     ---      D1
    PC6     ---      D0
    PA0     --       Reset
    GND     ---      PWNDN
    ```

## Files for the application

On this platform, the mros2 application consists of the following files:

- app.cpp: 
  - main source of the application
  - your own file name(s) that include mros2 API can be specified at the top of `build.bash`
  - you also need to edit `add_executable` in `CMakeLists.txt` to specify source code of the application

## Generating header files for custom MsgTypes

You can use almost any [built-in-types in ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/About-ROS-Interfaces.html#field-types) on the embedded device.

In additon, you can define a customized message type (e.g., `Twist.msg`) in the same way as in ROS 2, and use its header file for your application. This section describes how to generate header files for your own MsgTypes (`geometry_msgs::msg::Twist` as an example).

### Prepare .msg files

`.msg` files are simple text files that describe the fields of a ROS message (see [About ROS 2 interface](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/About-ROS-Interfaces.html)). In mros2, they are used to generate header files for messages in embedded applications.

Prepare `Twist.msg` file and make sure it is in `workspace/custom_msgs/geometry_msgs/msg/`.

```
$ cat workspace/custom_msgs/geometry_msgs/msg/Twist.msg
geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3 linear
geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3 angular
```

In this example, `Twist` has a nested structure with `Vector3` as a child element. So you also need to prepare its file.

```
$ cat workspace/custom_msgs/geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3.msg
float64 x
float64 y
float64 z
```

### Generate header files

To generate header files for `Twist` and `Vector3`, run the following command in `workspace/`.

```
$ cd workspace
$ python3 ../mros2/mros2_header_generator/header_generator.py geometry_msgs/msg/Twist.msg
```

Make sure header files for custom MsgType are generated in `custom_msgs/`.

```
$ ls -R custom_msgs/
custom_msgs/:
geometry_msgs

custom_msgs/geometry_msgs:
msg

custom_msgs/geometry_msgs/msg:
twist.hpp  vector3.hpp  Twist.msg  Vector3.msg
```

You can now use them in your applicaton like this.

```
#include "mros2.hpp"
#include "geometry_msgs/msg/vector3.hpp"
#include "geometry_msgs/msg/twist.hpp"

int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
<snip.>
  pub = node.create_publisher<geometry_msgs::msg::Twist>("cmd_vel", 10);
<snip.>
```

## Tips 1: Configure the network

`include/rtps/config.h` is the configuration file for embeddedRTPS.
We may be able to realize the RTPS communication to the appropriate configuration by editting this file.

And also, you can configure for lwIP (UDP/IP) by `mbed_app.json`. 
Currently, we are unable to communicate large size of messages probably due to these configurations. 

We should seek the appropreate configurations or how to fit them to the demand of applications.
Please let us know about them if you have any opinions or awesome knowledges! 

## Tips 2: Getting started in 5 minutes with the online compiler

> Caution: 
> Although you can easily try out the basic features of mros2 online, this environment has not been fully maintained.
> Note that new features such as uniquely defined message types are not available.

We also provide an online development environment for mros2-mbed. 
By using the following Codes on Keil Studio Cloud (a.k.a Mbed Online Complier), you can try out the power of mros2 just in 5 minute. (we wish :D
